## Introduction
People nowadays can easily get access to highly diverse and huge amount of music from Pandora or Spotify. Meanwhile, the demands for soundtracks that suit listeners' discrete tastes and lifestyles are growing. We’d like to develop a music recommendation web application to help users find music which fit their mood and make them feel good. People’ mood would be recognized from a photo uploaded by the user. The picture could be a selfie or any other pictures which reflect users current moods. With the image recognition and music recommendation APIs provided by AWS, a mood-music mapping would be designed. For example, romantic music would be recommended to a sad guy who needs some comfort, and dancing music would probably be recommended to a guy of high spirits. For the neutral mood, a randomly chosen hot music would be returned. We also provide a music social function in the public music channel page. Users could share the music recommended by our app to the public music channel, music in which is available to all users.
